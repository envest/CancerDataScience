Cancer genomics shows us new ways to look at old biology.
We will learn the fundamentals of cancer biology, the genomic technologies used to study tumors, and the computational methods necessary to analyze and present the data.
You will develop marketable programming skills (R, python) to get hands on experience working with real cancer data, and we will work together as a team to address an open research question with the goal of publication.
