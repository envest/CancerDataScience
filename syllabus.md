## Learning Objectives

### Resources we will use in CDS

### Course structure

We will meet for class on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.
Typically, there will be prep work to do before each class, and sometimes we will have a short quiz.
The default mode of this course is active learning.
That means when we come to class, we can expect to be engaged with our peers and doing hands-on learning.
There are lots of benefits to this approach, and it's how you will work every day as a scientist or in any other profession.

## Classroom policies

### Grading

We are here to learn and grow, and there is not a great way for me to give numerical grades to our activities in this class.
Each of you brings a unique background and experience level, and I want to reward your participation in the learning process.
I expect that each of you is capable of doing "A" work toward achieving the course objectives. So show me!

Ways to demonstrate active engagement in this class:
- Be prepared for class 
- Come to class and be ready for active learning
- Ask questions, come to office hours, email me
- Make progress toward achieving your individual learning goals

### COVID safety

I am fully vaccinated and wear a mask while indoors in both my professional and private life.
All students are required to wear a proper mask while in the classroom.
Rutgers is continuing to update their recommendations (updates & official protocols).
We will abide by university guidelines and live by a classroom covenant to make smart choices and keep everybody healthy.

Covenant: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented life-threatening challenges and continues to expose systemic inequalities across society.
We want to treat each other with compassion and respect in every way.
Let’s cultivate a space where we care about each other and do our best to promote understanding, fairness, justice, and equity.

### Mental Health Statement
Your mental health is important to me.
There are many demands placed on college students, both inside and outside of the classroom.
If you are struggling or need someone to talk with, please reach out to me or visit the Rutgers Camden Student Wellness Center.

### Students with Disabilities Statement
Rutgers University welcomes students with disabilities into all of the University's educational programs.
To receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, a student with a disability must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide (documentation)[https://ods.rutgers.edu/students/documentation-guidelines].
If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus’s disability services office will provide you with a Letter of Accommodations.
Please share this letter with your professor to discuss the accommodations needed as early in your course as possible.

### University Academic Integrity Statement
Rutgers University takes academic integrity very seriously and provides (resources)[https://deanofstudents.camden.rutgers.edu/academic-integrity] for you to know what that means.
By enrolling in this course, you assume responsibility for familiarizing yourself with the Academic Integrity Policy and the possible penalties (including suspension and expulsion) for violating the policy.
The policy states that all suspected violations will be reported to the Office of Community Standards.
